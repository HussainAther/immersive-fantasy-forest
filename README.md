# Immersive Fantasy Forest

## Overview
The **Immersive Fantasy Forest** project is a cutting-edge demonstration of real-time rendering techniques, shading, dynamic lighting, and interactivity designed for VR/AR platforms. Built with cinematic-quality visuals, it serves as a showcase for leveraging the latest in graphics technology, targeted towards platforms like Unreal Engine, Unity, and NVIDIA Omniverse.

## Features

### Real-Time Rendering Pipelines
- Custom deferred and forward+ rendering techniques.
- Advanced optimizations: frustum culling, LOD systems, shadow cascades.

### Advanced Shading
- **Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)**: High-quality materials for realism.
- Custom shaders:
  - Subsurface scattering for lifelike foliage.
  - Reflective water with Fresnel and parallax mapping.
  - Volumetric fog with dynamic scattering.

### Dynamic Lighting
- Real-time global illumination (GI) for immersive environments.
- Volumetric lighting effects (e.g., god rays, atmospheric haze).
- Dynamic emissive materials (e.g., glowing mushrooms).

### Texture Mapping
- Seamless blending techniques:
  - Triplanar mapping.
  - Procedural textures for moss, bark, and ground.
- Detail textures for realism in close-up views.

### Interactivity
- Physics-based effects (e.g., swaying foliage, responsive water).
- Real-time material changes: wet surfaces, glowing effects.
- Particle effects for enhanced immersion (e.g., fireflies, magical sparkles).

### Performance Optimization
- GPU profiling and performance tuning.
- Techniques like DLSS, TAA, and efficient texture streaming.
- Level-of-Detail (LOD) optimizations for high frame rates.
